\subsection{Scope and Evaluation}

The projectâ€™s scope is limited to simulated humanoid control without perception.
Experiments evaluate how well language-conditioned policies generalize to unseen text prompts within predefined skill categories such as reaching, stepping, turning, grasping, pushing, and balancing.

We evaluate on the following axes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physical validity:} trajectory stability and balance.
    \item \textbf{Task execution:} correct motion given text input.
    \item \textbf{Smoothness:} motion continuity and energy efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Infrastructure}

Experiments are run using the MJLab environment (MuJoCo + RSL) and PyTorch.
Model training leverages diffusion-based motion generation conditioned on text embeddings from pretrained language models.
