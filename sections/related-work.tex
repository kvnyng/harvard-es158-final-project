Recent humanoid control frameworks such as BeyondMimic, ExBody2, Expressive Whole Body Control, FALCON, and AMO have demonstrated progress in motion imitation and task-specific control.
However, these approaches are limited to single-behavior policies.

Language-conditioned control has been explored in manipulation and locomotion tasks, but its application to whole-body humanoid control remains underdeveloped.
Diffusion-based trajectory modeling has shown promise for motion generation, offering a scalable, probabilistic formulation for learning complex dynamics from data.

Our work seeks to combine these advances by developing a language-conditioned trajectory diffusion model capable of generating stable, task-consistent humanoid behaviors.
