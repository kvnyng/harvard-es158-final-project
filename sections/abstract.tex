We propose a language-conditioned whole-body control framework for humanoid robots.
Our approach aims to map natural language commands to dynamically stable, full-body control trajectories.
By pretraining a trajectory diffusion model on large-scale motion datasets and fine-tuning on high-quality humanoid data, the system learns versatile, text-controllable motion generation.
The resulting controller enables general-purpose, physically grounded humanoid behaviors from textual prompts such as “turn left” or “reach forward.”
This project explores the integration of natural language understanding with optimal control and reinforcement learning for expressive humanoid motion generation.
